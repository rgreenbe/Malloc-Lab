Malloc Lab
========
Malloc is an assignment from my class 15-213 (Introduction to Computer Systems) that I took Spring 2013. In this lab I used an explicit free list for memory allocation and optimized by implementing coalescing and a best fit policy.

The repository for this is private because of school policy. If you are potential employer and would like to see this please let me know and I can share it with you.
